Immediate things:

 No. 1 requested new feature for joe: syntax highlighting.  I have termcap.c
 and scrn.c with color support.  I need to merge it in.  I still need a
 database for syntax highlighting.  Emacs re-colors after no activity.

 Gettext: merge yes or no?  I need a non-english speaking
 person to tell how well this works.

 UTF-8 support.  Play with UTF-8 xterm.
 
 Define what constitutes a word for ^X ^Z ^W ^O.

 Update man page.

 Include documentation for joe hackers.  I wrote a lot of this
 some time, I need to find it.

 Search should try to scroll window so that entire found text is displayed on
 screen.  I had implemented this once, but it was broken.

 Error parser for ^[ c is abysmal.  Should define regexes for them.

 Add .v, .pl, etc. file types to joerc

 Get shell windows working in cygwin.  ptys exists but are very broken.

 Make tab completion more like bash?

 Emit ESC c to reset terminal on startup?
 Don't use tabs by default?

 Mode to prevent te, ti sequences.  I hate the restore previous
 screen contents on quit behavior.

 Expand math mode (hex, octal, math functions...)

 Interactive macros during file load are broken.  Think about multiple
 stack hack (otherwise template based C++ callbacks).

 File selection menu window should be more than one line.

 Should have switch buffers in current window as more fundamental joe key
 sequence.

 Look into clearing right-most column.

 ` and autoindent mode are a problem for drag and drop.
 any way we can distinguish normal typing from a drop?

 should ignore wordwrap when overtype mode is enabled.  they
 interact very badly together.

 joe a b c
 windows are not in order a, b, c

 joe should open tty earlier in startup sequence because ^Y
 is suspend character on sun.

 Don't understand:  optionally break hardlinks on save?  what is "tla"?

 Ctrl-left arrow, etc. give codes in modern Lini- should somehow make
 use of these.

 I've seen spell check lock up joe.

 Reopen files which have become newer.  Example given is
   joe a.c b.c
   ^K ^Z
   cvs update
   P a.c
   P b.c
   fg
   oops joe is editing old files...










FEATURES
=-=-=-=-
	-=- syntax higlighting
	-=- gettext (possibility of translate messages from joe)
	-=- folding

	from joe2.8
	-=- picture mode
	-=- brief emulation? EDT emulation?
	-=- save editor state
	-=- CR-LF mode for joe editing DOS files in linux?
	-=- xedit and folding stuff
		- with seperate valid-line database?
		- display update algorithm will break
	-=- hexadecimal edit mode
	-=- fixed record length edit mode
	-=- verticle windows
		- difficult to get scrolling to work right

PROGRAM REDeSIGN:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
	-=- why to use list of help screens and array of help screens
		when later is only array used ?
	-=- prepare sources to use gettext
	-=- add prototypes for functions
	-=- clean sources
	-=- add documentation

PORTABILITY
=-=-=-=-=-=
	-=- WARNING: MSDOS compatibility can be broken by my changes
		I try to use ANSI/ISO C but sometimes 
		I have to use POSIX extentsions so if you want to 
		have a DOS version, plz mail me your patches
	-=- MSDOS
		- how to give memory back during shell escapes?
	-=- make identifier length significant in first 8 (6?) places 
		for old C compilers


BuGS
=-=-
Emacs emulation improvements:
	- Rectangle mode for emacs yank system
	- Overtype mode works for yank
	- Query save loop? for kill-emacs and compile
	- Emacs reload from file function? ^X ^V 
		(it just works out if ^X ^V kills all instances of the buffer)
	- Bufed should display unnamed buffers
	- ESC args should work differently in emacs
	- nextword,nextword,prevword sequence 
		doesn't work for marking next successive word at ends of lines
	- exiting options and i-search with ESC is not pretty
		(it isn't in emacs either)
	- Allow either direct screen access or normal tty support 
		for DOS version.
