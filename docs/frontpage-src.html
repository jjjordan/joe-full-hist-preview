<p>JOE is the professional freeware ASCII text screen editor for UNIX. 
It makes full use of the power and versatility of UNIX, but lacks the steep
learning curve and basic nonsense you have to deal with in every other UNIX
editor. JOE has the feel of most IBM PC text editors: The key-sequences are
reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo-C.  JOE is much more powerful than those
editors, however.  JOE has all of the features a UNIX user should expect:
full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update optimizations (JOE is
fully usable at 2400 baud), simple installation, and all of the
UNIX-integration features of VI.</p>

<p>JOE's initialization file determines much of JOE's personality and
the name of the initialization file is simply the name of the editor
executable followed by "rc".  JOE comes with four "rc" files in addition to
the basic "joerc", which allow it to emulate these editors:</p>

<ul>
<li>JPICO</li>
<p>An enhanced version of the Pine mailer system's PICO editor.</p>

<li>JSTAR</li>
<p>A complete imitation of WordStar including many "JOE" extensions.</p>

<li>RJOE</li>
<p>A restricted version of JOE which allowed you to edit 
only the files specified on the command line.</p>

<li>JMACS</li>
<p>A GNU-EMACS imitation which is about one order of magnitude smaller than real
GNU-EMACS.</p>
</ul>

<p>Features:</p>

<p>JOE has a well thought-out user-interface with great attention to
detail.  The Page Up and Page Down functions do not move the cursor relative
to the edges of the screen.  Left and Right arrow keys work at the beginning
and ends of lines.  The cursor can move past the ends of lines without
jumping, but also without inserting or deleting extra spaces at the ends of
lines. Control characters and characters above 127 can be displayed and
entered- even ^Q and ^S.  The cursor's row and column number can be
displayed in the status line.</p>

<p>The key layout is made to reduce terminal incompatibility nonsense. 
^Q and ^S are not used and both ^H and DEL are mapped to backspace.  Case
does not matter in key sequences- ^K E, ^K e, and ^K ^E are each mapped to
the same function.  The arrow keys and PageUp, PageDown, Home, End, Insert
and Delete keypad keys are read from the termcap entry and are assigned to
the proper functions.  A simple initialization file, similar to Semware's
Q-EDIT, allows key-bindings, simple macros and help windows to be
defined.</p>

<p>JOE has full termcap/terminfo support and will work on any terminal. 
JOE has the best screen update optimization algorithm available.  It uses
VT100-style scrolling regions the way they are supposed to be used (I.E.,
without building insert and delete line functions out of them) and has a
powerful line shifting (insert/delete character) algorithm which works even
if text goes past the ends of lines.  JOE has deferred screen update to
handle typeahead and uses the baud rate reported by 'stty' to ensure that
deferral is not bypassed by tty buffering.</p>

<p>JOE has multiple windows and lacks the confusing notion of a named
buffers.  You just have files and windows.  When there are more windows than
can fit on the screen, the Goto-Next-Window function scrolls through them. 
The same file can have multiple windows opened on it.</p>

<p>JOE has VI-style unix integration.  You can filter a highlighted
block through a UNIX command.  Also, each place in joe which accepts a file
name (including the command line) will also accept:</p>

<ul>
<li>!command</li>
<p>to pipe into or out of a command</p>
<li>&gt;&gt;filename</li>
<p>to append to a file</p>
<li>filename,start,size</li>
<p>to edit a portion of a file/device</p>
<li>-</li>
<p>to use stdin or stdout</p>
</ul>

<p>File names on the command line may be preceded by +nnn to start
editing at a specified line.</p>

<p>JOE has shell windows.  You can run a shell in a window and any
output from commands run in the shell gets stored in a buffer.</p>

<p>JOE has an orthogonal event-driven design.  Each prompt is actually
a normal edit buffer containing a history of all of the responses entered
for that prompt.  You can use all of the normal edit commands to create file
names and search strings.  You can use the up arrow key (or search backwards
and any other appropriate edit command) to go back through the history of
previous responses.  Prompts are reentrant- meaning that edit commands which
require prompts can still be used inside of prompts.</p>

<p>JOE has TAB-completion and file selection menus.  If you hit tab in
a file name prompt, the name is either completed or a menu of possible
matches appears.</p>

<p>JOE stores edit files in a doubly linked list of gap buffers which
can spill into a temporary file.  You can edit files of any size up to the
amount of free disk space and there are no line-length restrictions.  Since
the buffering system is block-based, JOE will incur only a minimum of
swapping on heavily loaded systems.</p>

<p>When you ask for help, one of six small help reference cards appears
on the screen and remains while you continue to use the editor.  Here is the
first help card:</p>

<p>
CURSOR           GO TO            BLOCK      DELETE   MISC         EXIT
^B left ^F right ^U  prev. screen ^KB begin  ^D char. ^KJ reformat ^KX save
^P up   ^N down  ^V  next screen  ^KK end    ^Y line  ^T  options  ^C  abort
^Z previous word ^A  beg. of line ^KM move   ^W >word ^@  insert   ^KZ shell
^X next word     ^E  end of line  ^KC copy   ^O word< ^R  retype   FILE
SEARCH           ^KU top of file  ^KW file   ^J >line SPELL        ^KE new
^KF find text    ^KV end of file  ^KY delete ^_ undo  ^[N word     ^KR insert
^L  find next    ^KL to line No.  ^K/ filter ^^ redo  ^[L file     ^KD save
</p>

<p>JOE has a powerful set of editing commands suitable for editing both
text files and programs:</p>

<ul>
<li>UTF-8 support</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting</li>
<li>search and replace system, including powerful regular expressions (including matching of balanced C
expressions).</li>
<li>tags file search</li>
<li>paragraph format</li>
<li>undo and redo</li>
<li>position history allows you to get back to previous
editing contexts and allows you to quickly flip between
editing contexts</li>
<li>multiple keyboard macros</li>
<li>block move/copy/delete/filter</li>
<li>rectangle (columnar) mode</li>
<li>overtype/insert modes</li>
<li>indent/unindent</li>
<li>goto matching ( [ {</li>
<li>auto-indent mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus many options can be set:</p>
<ul>
<li>can have EMACS-style cursor re-centering on scrolls</li>
<li>characters between 128-255 can be shown as-is for non-English character
sets</li>
<li>Final newline can be forced on end of file</li>
<li>Can start with a help screen on</li>
<li>Left/Right margin settings</li>
<li>Tab width</li>
<li>Indentation step and fill character</li>
</ul>
