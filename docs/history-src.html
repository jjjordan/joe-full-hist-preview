<h3>wordstar - 1984</h3>

<p>At age 15, I got my first high-tech job at a small company called Video
Data Systems in Hauppauge Long Island New York.  The founder of VDS was Bill
Leventer.  There I wrote 6800 and 6809 assembly language code for video
titling systems on a Motorola Exorciser development system.  The code was
pretty sophisticated- I wrote an multi-tasking operating system for 6809. 
The Exorciser had a line editor called 'E', an assembler called 'RASM' and
two 8 in. floppy drives.  I remember that it took half an hour to link 16K
of code and that we always printed the assembly language lists on an old GE
chain printer.</p>

<p>One program I wrote was the screen editor for the CG-2000 character
generator.  This was ridiculously simple- it had fixed width lines stored in
a big array.  But it did have formatting- specifically, you could set the
heights of lines.  ...</p>

<p>At some point, we upgraded to an IBM PC XT and switched to the AD2500
6809 assembler and used WordStar in "non-document mode" for the editor.  I
remember being annoyed with WordStar because it did not remember the column
position when you moved the cursor between lines.  On the other hand, I
thought the interruptable screen update algorithm was pretty cool- it was
certainly a total necessity on the 4.77 MHz 8088 based system.  I also learned
C on the IBM PC, using Microsoft's MS-DOS C compiler.</p>

<h3>The DecSystem 20 - 1986</h3>

<p>In 1986 I went to college at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, majoring in
electrical engineering.  WPI was one of the great hacker schools, with many
students writing programs both before and during my time there.  WPI had a
Decsystem-20 mainframe computer which ran TOPS-20.  This was a famous 36-bit
computer, especially in the LISP world, because each word could hold two
18-bit addresses and was therefore perfect for a LISP CONS cell.  It had an
awesome mail program, which was both mail and USENET news in one program. 
The shell had ESC-completion and question-mark help (if you hit ? at the end
of syntactically correct command, it said "(confirm)").  It had EDT, TECO,
EMACS written in TECO, and a bunch of other editors, many of them student
written.  Despite all that, I tended to write in macro using a line editor. 
I tried the C compiler, but it was really weird- it used 9-bit bytes!  Mind
you, characters were normally 7-bits on this machine, with 5 characters
packed into a 36-bit word.  I remember that the operating system manual
which was written by someone at Stanford (who?) was always missing from the
library- borrowed months at a time by hackers.</p>

you a good feel for what the DEC-20 was like.</p>

<h3>The Encore Multimax - 1988</h3>

<p>In 1988 WPI replaced the DEC-20 with an Encore Multimax which ran a
version of UNIX called Umax.  Originally, the system lacked USENET, so a
friend of mine, Larry Foard, wrote a local BBS system for it called bboard. 
Bboard had a terrible line editor, so I wrote a screen editor called 'e' for
writing BBS messages.  This is really the first version of JOE.  Other
hackers wrote 's'- an instant messaging program, and 'superwho'- a program
which drew a map show which terminal each student was logged in on.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encore_Computer">Here</a> is some
history of Encore.  The company's "Annex" terminal servers had longer history
than its computers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.farviolet.com">Larry Foard</a> went on to write <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSH">TinyMush</a>.

<p>Why not emacs or vi?  I couldn't stand emacs- it was always saying "garbage
collecting...  done.", used awkward weird keys, formatted my code the wrong
way and basically just had an arrogant attitude.  It was especially
frustrating that Ctrl-H was not backspace.  I was certainly too impatient to
conform to it when I could just write my own editor.</p>

<p>JOE might never have been had I understood how nice vi
was at the time.  Luckily, the commands were not documented in the 'man'
page and both it and the UNIX line editors 'ex' and 'ed' did not work like
the line editors I was familiar with.  Specifically, I thought it was stupid
that these editor did not allow you to position the cursor past the ends of
lines (or files), forcing you to use the append command instead of the
insert command for this case.</p>
