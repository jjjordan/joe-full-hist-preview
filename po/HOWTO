To create a translation for JOE:

	- Create a new .po file and edit in your translations.  You can
start with any of the existing .po files, or the joe.pot file.

	- Strings containing <> are character sets for single-key answers,
	  like 'y' for yes and 'n' for no.  The format of these strings
	  should be:
		"xxx<>yyy"

		  where: xxx is a list of 8-bit characters.
		    and: yyy is a list of UTF-8 characters.

	  Both the 8-bit and UTF-8 versions of the characters must always be
	  given.  For example, "yY<>yY" is the yes_string for english.  'y'
	  and 'Y' can be entered by the user.

	- Verify the .po file with:

		msgfmt --check-format de.po

	This verifies that the number of printf format string directives
has been preserved in your translations.  It also generates a binary
version of the .po, but we don't need it.

	- Copy the .po file into ~/.joe/lang  You should be able to try it
now.  Run JOE like this to set a particular language: LANG=de_DE joe

	- Translate the on-line help in the joerc file and call it joerc.de

	- If you feeling ambitious, translate the man page.  It goes
	here: /usr/share/man/de/man1/joe.1

	- Upload the files to the patch area of
http://sourceforge.net/projects/joe-editor so that others can use them.  I will
include them in the next version of JOE.
